# System Design Documentation

Welcome to the system design docs for the BBC News Android app. These documents describe
how the application is structured, how modules collaborate, and the modern architectural
choices that keep the codebase scalable and maintainable.

## Documents
- **architecture.md** — High-level architecture, system context, and core design principles.
- **modules.md** — Module responsibilities, boundaries, and dependency rules.
- **data-flow.md** — Request/response flow from UI to network and back.

## How to Use
- Start with **architecture.md** for the big picture.
- Use **modules.md** to understand where to place new code.
- Consult **data-flow.md** when debugging or extending features.
